       Socket successfully created
       socket binded to 27015
       socket is listening
  2. Windows: In a File Explorer window, navigate to the VehicleVisionSimulator
       folder and double-click on VehicleVision.exe to start the simulator
     Linux/MacOS: Navigate to the VehicleVisionSimulator folder and run
       LaunchSimulator.sh

### Simulator Controls:
  - [spacebar]: Pause the simulator (the LaneTracker application will wait)
  - [esc]: End the simulation
  - [up],[down],[left],[right]: In manual driving mode, use arrow keys to
    drive the vehicle
  - [ctrl]+[alt]+[enter]: Toggle the simulator between full screen mode and
